The DAF-drafting and guidance during interview was crucial to boost my confidence and explore the otherwise hidden areas of my DAF. The one on one session helped me further analyse and perfect my answers. Thank you for your support and best wishes throughout the process sir. Grateful for the same.

You didn’t just teach UPSC subjects—you taught me how to think, how to approach answers, and most importantly, how to believe in myself. Whenever I felt confused or demotivated, you guided me patiently and pushed me forward.UPSC is not easy, but with the right mentor, the journey becomes meaningful. I am truly grateful to you sir for laying my foundation strong.
