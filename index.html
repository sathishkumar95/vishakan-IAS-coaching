           stage of the Civil Services Examination—from the Prelims race pressure, to the Mains marathon 
           stress, and finally to the calm composure required for the Interview personality test.

The DAF-drafting and guidance during interview was crucial to boost my confidence and explore the otherwise hidden areas of my DAF. The one on one session helped me further analyse and perfect my answers. Thank you for your support and best wishes throughout the process sir. Grateful for the same.
